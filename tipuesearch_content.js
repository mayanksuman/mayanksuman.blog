Defining closure functions is possible in languages which has first-class functions like Python, JavaScript, Lua, Scheme, and others. Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 def divisiblity_check ( divisor ): \"\"\"Factory for producing functions that check divisiblity with divisor.\"\"\" def inner_func ( divident ): return ( divident % divisor == 0 ) return inner_func This closure function ( divisiblity_check ) is return another function as evident by syntax. It should be noted that environment for inner function ( i.e. , the variable divisor ) is also saved with the returned function. Hence, following line of codes work: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 div_by_7 = divisiblity_check ( 7 ) div_by_19 = divisiblity_check ( 19 ) div_by_7 ( 38 ) # return false div_by_19 ( 38 ) # return true div_by_7 ( 35 ) # return true div_by_19 ( 35 ) # return false Here, although the functions div_by_7 and div_by_19 are returned by same closure function; however they have different environment attached to them and hence produce different results. The example closure function ( i.e. , divisiblity_check ) can also be defined using anonymous function. 1 2 3 4 def divisiblity_check ( divisor ): \"\"\"Factory for producing functions that check divisiblity with divisor.\"\"\" return lambda divident : ( divident % divisor == 0 ) This usage is sometimes called anonymous closure function.","tags":"Programming","url":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/21_May_2021_closure-functions/","loc":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/21_May_2021_closure-functions/"},{"title":"First Class Functions","text":"In most programming languages, type, object, entity, or value is considered first-class object and hence can be returned from a function, modified or assigned to a variable. If a programming language considers functions as first-class object, then the programming language is said to have first-class functions. Hence, in such programming languages (like Python, JavaScript and others), a function can be assigned to variable, modified or returned from a higher order function. Usually such languages also supports anonymous functions. First-class function is one of the necessity for functional programming; hence all functional programming languages (such as Haskell, Scala, Clojure etc.) have first-class functions. Example 1 2 3 p = print p ( \"Hi! Check out this text.\" ) p . __call__ ( \"Hi! Check out this text.\" ) Here print function is assigned to variable p and then called using syntax p(...) similar to print(...) . It should be noted that the last line is specific to python only. In python almost every thing is a object. Functions are special object that __call__ data structure function (or member) defined for them. This __call__ member function have all the logic for the parent function; hence calling print(...) is same as print.__call__(...) .","tags":"Programming","url":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/20_May_2021_first-class-functions/","loc":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/20_May_2021_first-class-functions/"},{"title":"Mounting qcow2 drive","text":"The qcow2 (or QEMU copy-on-write) is a virtual disk image format primarly used by QEMU for guest systems. In many circustances, such as reseting passwords, editting or recovering files etc., mouting a qcow2 disk images without running a guest system is required. This can be acheived by Network Block Device module (or nbd ) on host linux system. At first, we need to define maximum number of partitions expected for the qcow2 disk and then the disk can be mouted with following commands: 1 2 3 4 modprobe nbd max_part=8 # maximum partition = 8 qemu-nbd --connect=/dev/nbd0 /var/lib/vz/images/100/vm-100-disk-1.qcow2 fdisk /dev/nbd0 -l # For finding virtual machine partitions mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt/somepoint/ #mount partition on /mnt/somepoint The disk image can be unmounted with following commands: 1 2 3 umount /mnt/somepoint/ qemu-nbd --disconnect /dev/nbd0 rmmod nbd Depending upon system configuration, you may need to run either one or all commands as root user.","tags":"Software","url":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/31_Jan_2021_mounting-qcow2-drive/","loc":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/31_Jan_2021_mounting-qcow2-drive/"},{"title":"Windows 10 guest on QEMU","text":"I use Linux (Debian) as my daily driver. However, for some softwares only available on the Windows platform, I use Windows 10 VM in QEMU (managed using virt-manager ). There is a myth about the Windows 10 guest under QEMU that they are slow compared to other virtualization techniques/softwares (VirtualBox, VMWare, and others). Surely, the default values in virt-manager do not result in the most performant Windows virtual machine out of box. Still, with the following tips one can get a very performant virtual machine setup (with low computational load additionally): Please ensure that the disk file to be created for the virtual machine is not on a BTRFS partition. Furthermore, at the last step of new virtual machine wizard in virt-manager , click Customize configuration before install . In the next dialog box, change the disk bus of SATA Disk 1 and device model of Network Interface Card ( NIC ) to VirtIO . Windows do not have VirtIO drivers, so attach a new SATA CDROM with the latest VirtIO iso file downloaded from virtio-archive . After doing all these setting, start the installation. During installation, Windows will notify about missing disk, which can be troubleshot by navigating to the appropriate disk driver file in viostor folder in the VirtIO driver iso. After installation, install additional drivers from VirtIO driver disk. Additionally, install other SPICE drivers , specially spice-guest-tools and Spice WEBDAV Daemon . Debloat it with Windows 10 Debloater and enhance your privacy with O&O ShutUp10 . Please ensure that before running Windows10Debloater , execution policy in Powershell (Administrator) is unrestrictive ( Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted ). Don't forget to change the execution policy afterward ( Set-ExecutionPolicy restricted ). Additional Tip: For sharing files from Linux host, you have two options a) by USB redirection of attached pen drive b) by WebDAV. For using WebDAV, Spice WebDAV Daemon should be installed in Windows guest. Add a new channel hardware with target name org.spice-space.webdav.0 . Start the Windows guest and connect it with remote-viewer ( remote-viewer spice://127.0.0.1:5900 ) and then use File > Preferences to select the folder to be shared. If this does not work, ensure that on the host machine (Linux), the user is a member of libvirt or other appropriate groups, and on the guest virtual machine (Windows), Spice WebDAV service is running.","tags":"Software","url":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/22_Jan_2021_windows-10-guest-on-qemu/","loc":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/22_Jan_2021_windows-10-guest-on-qemu/"},{"title":"Access data in lvm2 drive","text":"Prerequisite: The system should have lvm2 installed.

Install obs-studio by the command sudo apt install obs-studio . For using the output of obs-studio into video-conferencing software, obs-v4l2sink should be installed and properly configured.

The language is equally suited for learning as the first computer language (for kids) and running enterprise-level code (as done in many startups and established companies) at the same time. However, this incredible approachability of the language leads to very low quality of code (due non-pythonic way of writing code) and many misinterpretations about it. This series about generic python show use-cases and examples of pythonic code, which are clear and effective. Let us start with Zen of Python by Tim Peters, which can be accessed by code import this in python interpreter. The principles are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! We will use these principles as general guidance in this series.","tags":"Programming","url":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/30_Jul_2020_starting-up-a-series-of-python-language/","loc":"https://mayanksuman.in/posts/30_Jul_2020_starting-up-a-series-of-python-language/"},{"title":"Setting up Skype for web in Debian","text":"I do not prefer having closed source software on my Debian machine.
