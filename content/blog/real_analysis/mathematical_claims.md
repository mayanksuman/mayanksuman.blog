Lemma, proposition, theorem or corollary are different types of mathematical claims with different levels of importance and difficulty. Logically, these claims are same as all of them need a valid proof to be deemed true.

1. Lemma: easily proved and least interesting claim that can be used to prove other claims like proposition or theorem.
2. Proposition: interesting claim; however have lesser importance than theorem.
3. Theorem: most important claim that says something definitive for the subject, hence, often take more effort to prove than a proposition or lemma.
4. Corollary: quick consequence of theorem or proposition that was proved recently in the text.
