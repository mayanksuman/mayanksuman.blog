Similar to Hilbert's 23 problems in mathematics, International Association of
Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) compiled some of the most significant Unsolved
problems in hydrology (UPH) with the help of community. The list of following 23
problems were published in a 2019 paper.[^1]

### Time variability and change
1. [Is the hydrological cycle regionally accelerating/decelerating under climate
and environmental change, and are there tipping points (irreversible
changes)?](|filename|prob_hydrological_cycle_change.md)
2. How will cold region runoﬀ and groundwater change in a warmer climate
(e.g. with glacier melt and permafrost thaw)?
3. What are the mechanisms by which climate change and water use alter
ephemeral rivers and groundwater in (semi-) arid regions?
4. What are the impacts of land cover change and soil disturbances on water
and energy ﬂuxes at the land surface, and on the resulting groundwater
recharge?

### Space variability and scaling
5. What causes spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity in runoﬀ, evaporation,
subsurface water and material ﬂuxes (carbon and other nutrients,
sediments), and in their sensitivity to their controls (e.g. snow fall regime,
aridity, reaction coeﬃcients)?
6. What are the hydrologic laws at the catchment scale and how do they
change with scale?
7. Why is most ﬂow preferential across multiple scales and how does such
behaviour co-evolve with the critical zone?
8. Why do streams respond so quickly to precipitation inputs when storm
ﬂow is so old, and what is the transit time distribution of water in the
terrestrial water cycle?

### Variability of extremes
9. How do ﬂood-rich and drought-rich periods arise, are they changing, and if
so why?
10. Why are runoﬀ extremes in some catchments more sensitive to land-use/
cover and geomorphic change than in others?
11. Why, how and when do rain-on-snow events produce exceptional runoff?

### Interfaces in hydrology
12. What are the processes that control hillslope–riparian–stream–
groundwater interactions and when do the compartments connect?
13. What are the processes controlling the ﬂuxes of groundwater across
boundaries (e.g. groundwater recharge, inter-catchment ﬂuxes and
discharge to oceans)?
14. What factors contribute to the long-term persistence of sources
responsible for the degradation of water quality?
15. What are the extent, fate and impact of contaminants of emerging
concern and how are microbial pathogens removed or inactivated in the
subsurface?

### Measurements and data
16. How can we use innovative technologies to measure surface and
subsurface properties, states and ﬂuxes at a range of spatial and temporal
scales?
17. What is the relative value of traditional hydrological observations vs soft
data (qualitative observations from lay persons, data mining etc.), and
under what conditions can we substitute space for time?
18. How can we extract information from available data on human and water
systems in order to inform the building process of socio-hydrological
models and conceptualisations?

### Modelling methods
19. How can hydrological models be adapted to be able to extrapolate to
changing conditions, including changing vegetation dynamics?
20. How can we disentangle and reduce model structural/parameter/input
uncertainty in hydrological prediction?

### Interfaces with society
21. How can the (un)certainty in hydrological predictions be communicated
to decision makers and the general public?
22. What are the synergies and tradeoﬀs between societal goals related to
water management (e.g. water–environment–energy–food–health)?
23. What is the role of water in migration, urbanisation and the dynamics of
human civilisations, and what are the implications for contemporary water
management?
