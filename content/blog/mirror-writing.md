According to some research on brain linguistic processing, we can not hear and speak (or do any two different activities involving language) simultaneous in effective way. This happens due to single language processing center in brain. There are evidences that amphidextrous people that write with both hands have two language centers. Additionally, people who can write and read mirror text have added reinforcement learning. According to one theory the process of rotating the linguistic object in memory before setting it to paper, and rotating it before reading it back, is a method of reinforcement learning.

In this regard, I set out following goals for myself:

1. spelling the words and sentences in reverse
2. develop a cursive writing system in mirror.
3. Practice so that the it become second nature

I want to use left hand for this job (but having an ability to mirror-write with both hand will be awesome) as 15% of left-handed people have the language centres in both halves of their brain.[^1] Additionally having two or more language processing center will help in various language related intelligence. Additionally more connection between unrelated parts of brain should be more advantageous.
