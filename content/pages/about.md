I am researcher studying/modeling climate change impacts on hydrological systems, statistical analysis of hydrological time series, and application of wavelet transformation and copula theory in hydroclimatic analysis.

I have recently submitted my Ph.D. Thesis titled "Analysis and Modeling of Climate Change Impact on Hydrological Extreme Events across India" (work carried out under the supervision of [Prof. Rajib Maity](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~rajibmaity/), Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur). Earlier, I have received my B.Tech. degree in Civil Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, India, in 2013, and M.Tech. degree in Hydraulics and Water Resources from Department of Civil Engineering IIT Kharagpur, India, in 2015.

More academic details and my list of publication are available in [my Curriculum Vitae]({static}/pages/cv.pdf).

### Apart from being a researcher, I am also

* An avid Open Source enthusiast and hence, regular contributor to multiple Open Source project. I am also `Arctic Code Vault Contributor` for 2020 Github Code Archive Program. More details are available at [my github account](https://github.com/mayanksuman).
* A marital artist. I hold First Degree Black Belt (Shodan) in Kyokyushin-kan Karate.
